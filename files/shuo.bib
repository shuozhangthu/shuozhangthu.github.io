  abstract = {In this paper we investigate the mass transfer of CO2 injected into a homogenous (sub)-surface porous formation saturated with a liquid. In almost all cases of practical interest CO2 is present on top of the liquid. Therefore, we perform our analysis to a porous medium that is impermeable from sides and that is exposed to CO2 at the top. For this configuration density-driven natural convection enhances the mass transfer rate of CO2 into the initially stagnant liquid. The analysis is done numerically using mass and momentum conservation laws and diffusion of CO2 into the liquid. The effects of aspect ratio and the Rayleigh number, which is dependent on the characteristics of the porous medium and fluid properties, are studied. This configuration leads to an unstable flow process. Numerical computations do not show natural convection effects for homogeneous initial conditions. Therefore a sinusoidal perturbation is added for the initial top boundary condition. It is found that the mass transfer increases and concentration front moves faster with increasing Rayleigh number. The results of this paper have implications in enhanced oil recovery and CO2 sequestration in aquifers. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},
