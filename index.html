<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>In order to model geochemical reactions together with subsurface flow and solute transport, reactive transport modeling (RTM) is receiving increasing interest <span class="citation">(C. I. Steefel, DePaolo, and Lichtner 2005)</span>. RTM refers to the creation of computer models that integrate chemical reactions with the transport of fluids through the Earth’s crust. Such models predict the distribution in space and time of the chemical reactions that occur along a flow path. Today, RTM has become an essential tool for the analysis of coupled physical, chemical, and biological processes in Earth systems. The advantage of this approach is that it links individual time- and space-dependent processes in complex natural systems.</p>
<p>In order to model hydro-geochemical problems on a large scale, RTM employs continuum representations of the porous medium and assumes the existence of a representative elementary volume where, for instance, flow can be described by Darcy’s law <span class="citation">(C. I. Steefel, DePaolo, and Lichtner 2005)</span>. A porous medium is treated as continuous domains with macroscopic flow and transport parameters such as hydraulic conductivity, porosity, dispersivity, as well as geochemical parameters such as reactive surface area and reaction rates. However, geochemical reactions such as mineral dissolution/precipitation modify the porous medium’s pore structure. An up-scaling procedure is needed to predict changes in hydraulic properties such as permeability, capillary pressure, and relative permeabilities within the framework of continuum-scale flow and transport models.</p>
<p>Currently the effects of chemical reactions on flow properties are represented as a relation between permeability and porosity in reactive transport modeling. Porosity is updated after chemical calculations from the change of mineral volumes, then permeability change is calculated from the porosity change using an empirical permeability-porosity relation, most commonly the Carman-Kozeny relation <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="kozeny1927kapillare"><strong>???</strong></span>; Carman 1956)</span>, or the <span class="citation">Verma and Pruess (1988)</span> relation. To the best of our knowledge, there are no closed-form relations available yet for the effects of chemical reactions on multi-phase flow properties, and thus currently these effects cannot be accounted for in reactive transport modeling.</p>
<p>This paper presents new constitutive relations to represent how chemical reactions affect multi-phase flow properties on the continuum scale based on the conceptual model of parallel capillary tubes. The parameters in our new relations are either pre-existing input in a multi-phase flow simulation (initial capillary pressure function), or intermediate modeling results (water saturation, changes in mineral volume). With those parameters the new relations can be implemented in an existing reactive transport simulator directly, without introducing new variables.</p>
<p>The change of porosity, permeability, and multi-phase flow parameters due to mineral reactions in a porous medium can be caused by different mechanisms in different scenarios. For example, <span class="citation">(K. Pruess and Müller 2009)</span> investigate permeability change due to salt precipitation in the context of CO<span class="math inline"><em></em><sub>2</sub></span> injection. The rational for this process is that during CO<span class="math inline"><em></em><sub>2</sub></span> injection, water evaporates into the CO<span class="math inline"><em></em><sub>2</sub></span> stream. Salinity starts to increase in the water and salt eventually precipitates out. <span class="citation">(K. Pruess and Müller 2009)</span> discuss how this ’dry out’ will impact injectivity by modeling the permeability change due to salt precipitation. Reduction of permeability can also be a consequence of bacterial growth in a porous medium as a consequence of groundwater recharge, water treatment or disposal processes, enhanced oil recovery schemes, or in-situ bioremediation of organic contaminants in groundwater <span class="citation">(Taylor and Jaffé 1990; Ginn et al. 2002; <span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="schafer1998simulation"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>. Plugging can be particularly severe for water injection and bioremediation projects, since both processes inject water containing relatively high levels of growth substrate and inorganic nutrients.</p>
<p>Mineral dissolution occurs where acid reacts with the surfaces of a porous medium. A common method of stimulating oil wells to achieve greater production is to inject acid into an oil bearing formation with the hope of significantly increasing the permeability in some region around the wellbore. The reacting acid will dissolve a portion of the porous solid thus changing the pore structure. The extent to which this dissolution of solid enhances permeability of the reservoir is essential to the design of an effective acid treatment <span class="citation">(Schechter and Gidley 1969; Hiorth, Cathles, and Madland 2010)</span>.</p>
<p>The relation between porosity change and permeability change is also relevant to the effects of diagenesis such as cementation or dissolution on reservoir quality prediction. Depending on the chemical and crystallographic properties, cements fill the intergranular pores and increase the tortuosity of the permeable medium. The result is a reduction in permeability compared to unaltered rock. The uncertainty of the location and chemical composition of various cements makes it difficult to predict their effects on permeability <span class="citation">(Panda and Lake 1995; Bjørkum and Nadeau 1998)</span>.</p>
<p>This paper is intended to provide the fundamental basis for making reliable estimates of the influence of pore structure on multi-phase flow properties. Our approach should yield results pertinent to the problems cited above. Indeed, any problem concerned with interaction of the porous solid-fluid system and its effects on multi-phase flow properties should be susceptible to arguments similar to these presented here.</p>
<h2 id="previous-relations">Previous Relations</h2>
<p>Mineral dissolution and precipitation reactions in subsurface porous media alter the structure of the pore network. The changes in pore structure manifest themselves in the constitutive relations that characterize the continuum-scale properties of the medium and are used in the governing equations of flow and transport. The question is how these effects can be accurately captured in modeling reactive transport in reservoirs. The porosity changes caused by mineral reactions can be easily related to precipitation or dissolution volume, but the permeability change associated with a change in porosity is a more complex problem, as the porosity-permeability correlations depend on many geometric factors such as pore-size distribution, pore shapes, and connectivity. Since there is a wide variation in these geometric properties among natural rock formations, the porosity-permeability correlations will generally depend on the rock type and will be site specific. Attempts to obtain this relationship by many investigators have produced results which differ considerably from each other. For example, <span class="citation">(Mavis and Wilsey 1937)</span> found the permeability of filter sands to be proportional to <span class="math inline"><em>ϕ</em><sup>5</sup></span> or <span class="math inline"><em>ϕ</em><sup>6</sup></span>, while <span class="citation">(Brace 1977)</span> found a 3rd power correlation with porosity for crystalline rocks. It is therefore obvious that no simple general correlation between porosity and permeability can be applied to all permeable materials. <span class="citation">(Xie et al. 2014)</span> discusses the implementation of permeability-porosity relationship in several reactive transport codes and conducted benchmark problems, but only the Carman-Kozeny relation is used in their models.</p>
<p>In fact we do not need an absolute permeability-porosity correlation but the relationship between their relative changes. Many investigators have proposed such relationships for different materials in which the porosity changes were brought about by different physical mechanisms. The straight capillary models have been frequently employed. <span class="citation">(Verma and Pruess 1988)</span> assume that the medium has a set of non-intersecting flow channels with either circular tubular or planar cross sections, and construct series of models that are able to represent pore throat effects. Minor changes in average porosity cause drastic permeability changes due to closure of the pore throats in their model, and they find that there is a non-zero critical porosity <span class="math inline"><em>ϕ</em><sub><em>c</em></sub></span> at which permeability reduces to zero.</p>
<p>The relations above assume that mineral dissolution and precipitation reactions occur in all pores and ignore the important fact that for multiphase flow, these reactions only occur in pores occupied by the water phase. For example, <span class="citation">(Ott, Roels, and De Kloe 2015)</span> observe in their CO<span class="math inline"><em></em><sub>2</sub></span> coring flooding experiment that precipitated salt occupies complementary space with initial CO<span class="math inline"><em></em><sub>2</sub></span> gas, and the overlap between salt precipitation and initial gas overlap less than 5%. As a result, these traditional approaches are applicable to the single-phase flow condition only, while multiphase flow is common in oil and gas reservoirs, geothermal reservoirs, geological carbon storage, and groundwater remediation. <span class="citation">(Liu et al. 2013)</span> use the concept of multi-phase flow in calculating the change of permeability due to a change in porosity. These authors argue that in multi-phase flow conditions, precipitation occurs only in the pore space occupied by brine, which corresponds to the small capillary tubes in the capillary tube model, since in most cases water is the wetting phase. They derive the relationship between permeability change and porosity change based on their conceptual model, and verify their predictions of new permeability with experimental results. However, although <span class="citation">Liu et al. (2013)</span> provide the relation of permeability change and chemical reactions, practical approaches to accurately estimate the effects of mineral dissolution and precipitation reactions on multiphase flow properties are not yet available.</p>
<p>This paper presents continuum-scale constitutive equations to calculate reaction-induced changes in capillary pressure and relative permeabilities. Section [S:3] presents the derivation of our new relationships. These new constitutive equations are fundamentally based on the capillary tube concept. One assumption in this concept is that the connectivity between pores in the rocks is represented by a group of capillary tubes. To test whether this assumption will affect our predictions in changes of capillary pressure and relative permeabilities, we present pore network modeling on a Berea sandstone in Section [S:4] and compare the results with predictions from the new continuum-scale equations.</p>
<p>The pore network models provide opportunities to study the change of hydraulic properties due to reactions because detailed information is available at the pore scale <span class="citation">(Algive et al. 2012)</span>. <span class="citation">(Raoof et al. 2013)</span> developed a pore-network modeling tool capable of simulating fluid flow and multi-component reactive and adsorptive transport under saturated and variably saturated conditions. Other researchers <span class="citation">(Nogues et al. 2013; Li, Peters, and Celia 2006; Varloteaux, Békri, and Adler 2013)</span> have also developed similar reactive transport models that are able to simulate the evolution of pore bodies within a network. These models can be used to understand the evolution of porosity and permeability in porous media at the pore scale, and aid in the representation of constitutive relationships such as a porosity-permeability curve that can be used to model larger scale processes in continuum scale models. However, to account for changes in conductivity at the pore-to-pore level due to changes in the pore body volume due to precipitation or dissolution of minerals, assumptions have to be made to correlate the change in volume of the pores to a change in throat diameter. For example, in <span class="citation">(Nogues et al. 2013)</span>, it is assumed that all pore throats are cylindrical in shape and have a characteristic diameter, and mineral precipitation or dissolution simply reduces the volume of the system and preferential precipitation/dissolution effects are not taken into account. Thus the conclusions for the porosity-permeability relationship from such models are mostly determined by how the pore-diameter change is related to pore-volume change.</p>
<h1 id="theory-development">Theory Development</h1>
<p>Our approach to derive the relation between chemical reactions and changes in capillary pressure and relative permeabilities are shown in Fig.[fig:workflow] and described as follows: starting with continuum-scale hydraulic properties, the pore size distribution (PS) function is calculated from the initial capillary pressure curve using the capillary tube concept. Changes in mineral volume through equilibrium or kinetic mineral reactions are then translated to changes in pore radii of the PSD by selectively changing the radii of water occupied pores. The resulting new PSD is converted back to an updated capillary pressure curve, which is then used for computing total permeability and relative permeabilities at the continuum scale. Note that our new development is based on the <span class="citation">(Mualem 1976)</span> or <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="van1980closed"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span> model for capillary pressure and relative permeability (before chemical reactions), but the procedure can be also applied to other models.</p>
<h2 id="change-in-pore-size-distribution">Change in Pore Size Distribution</h2>
<p>The pore space of a porous medium is conceptualized as cylindrical capillaries with a continuous distribution of radii <span class="math inline"><em>r</em></span>. A given capillary can be either water-filled or completely dry, depending on the saturation state of the medium. With this geometric idealization, the capillary pressure-water saturation curve can be interpreted to represent continuous cumulative pore-size distributions. In a given portion of the porous medium (in computational terms this would be a cell within the modeled domain), at any time the water content is known. Due to precipitation/dissolution, the pore volumes and pore sizes will change and thus the capillary pressure curve changes also. The maximum radius up to which pores are water-filled and therefore affected by mineral reactions can be calculated from the capillary pressure head:</p>
<p><br><span class="math display">$$r = \frac{\zeta}{h}$$</span><br></p>
<p>where <em>r</em> is the radius of capillary tubes, <em>h</em> is the capillary pressure head corresponding to the current effective water saturation <em>S</em>, and <span class="math inline"><em>ζ</em></span> is the capillary factor <span class="math inline">$\zeta = \frac{2\sigma cos \phi}{\rho g}$</span>. Effective water saturation is defined as:</p>
<p><br><span class="math display">$$\bar{S}=\frac{S-S_r}{1-S_{r}},$$</span><br></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline"><em>S</em></span> is the wetting-phase saturation (the ratio of wetting-phase volume to the corresponding bulk volume of pore space), and subscript <span class="math inline"><em>r</em></span> refers to the residual water saturation.</p>
<p>The capillary pressure head <em>h</em> can be related to effective wetting-phase saturation by <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="van1980closed"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>:</p>
<p><br><span class="math display">$$\bar{S}=[1+(\alpha h)^{n}]^{-m},$$</span><br></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline"><em>α</em></span> and <em>m=1-1/n</em> are empirical parameters.</p>
<p>Before mineral reactions occur, the relative permeability of the wetting phase <em><span class="math inline"><em>k</em><sub><em>r</em></sub></span></em> can be expressed by <span class="citation">Mualem (1976)</span>:</p>
<p><br><span class="math display">$$k_r=\bar{S}^{1/2} [\dfrac{\int_0^{\bar{s}} (1/h(x))dx}{\int_0^1 (1/h(x))dx}]^2 .$$</span><br></p>
<p>Using the mathematical relation <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="van1980closed"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>,</p>
<p><br><span class="math display">$$F(\bar{S})=\dfrac{\int_0^{\bar{s}} (1/h(x))dx}{\int_0^1 (1/h(x))dx}=1-(1-\bar{S}^{1/m})^m,$$</span><br></p>
<p>we have <br><span class="math display">$$k_{r}(\bar{S})=\bar{S}^{1/2}[1-(1-\bar{S}^{1/m})^m]^2.$$</span><br></p>
<p>The changes in pore geometry during mineral precipitation or dissolution are complex. However, in order to obtain a closed-form result, we need to make some simplifications. Here we assume a strict dependency of mineral reactions on solution concentrations. In other words, the amount of dissolved or precipitated mineral in a given pore is linearly dependent on its pore volume. Also, we assume that the change in pore volume is uniform within a given pore.</p>
<p>If we denote the brine saturation at the time when mineral reaction starts as <span class="math inline"><em>S</em><sub><em>p</em></sub></span>, then we can define the ratio of the pore volume after chemical reactions to that before reactions, <span class="math inline"><em>β</em></span>, as</p>
<p><br><span class="math display">$$\beta=\dfrac{S_p-S_{reaction}}{S_p},$$</span><br></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline"><em>S</em><sub><em>r</em><em>e</em><em>a</em><em>c</em><em>t</em><em>i</em><em>o</em><em>n</em></sub></span> is the content of precipitated or dissolved mineral, defined as the volume of mineral change divided by the bulk volume of pore space, and is positive for precipitation.</p>
<p>Given a porosity change from <span class="math inline"><em>ϕ</em><sub>0</sub></span> to <span class="math inline"><em>ϕ</em></span> of a porous medium due to mineral dissolution or precipitation, <span class="math inline"><em>β</em></span> can be calculated as</p>
<p><br><span class="math display">$$\beta = 1-\dfrac{(\phi_0-\phi)/\phi_0}{S_p}.$$</span><br></p>
<p>The ratio <span class="math inline"><em>δ</em></span> of the radius (for a pore after precipitation/dissolution) to its original radius can be approximated to be a power function of the corresponding volume ratio <span class="citation">(Liu et al. 2013)</span>:</p>
<p><br><span class="math display">$$\delta=\dfrac{r^*}{r}=\beta^{\chi},$$</span><br></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline"><em>r</em><sup>*</sup></span> is the radius after precipitation/dissolution, <span class="math inline"><em>r</em></span> is the original radius, and <span class="math inline"><em>χ</em></span> is an empirical parameter equal to 4.5. <span class="citation">(Liu et al. 2013)</span> discussed this power law in detail. They selected the value of 4.5 to be consistent with patchy distribution of deposits, which was observed from scanning electron micrograph study where salt crystal did not distribute uniformly within a pore, but grew inwardly. Readers are referred to the <span class="citation">(Liu et al. 2013)</span> paper and references therein.</p>
<p>In the previous study by <span class="citation">Verma and Pruess (1988)</span>, changes in mineral volume were modeled as affecting the entire pore spectrum even though mineral reactions occur only in the water-filled part of the pore space. Here we only translate changes in mineral volumes to pore radii in the wet part of the porous medium.</p>
<p>In a given portion of the porous medium, at any time the water saturation is known. The maximum radius up to which pores are water-filled and therefore affected by mineral reactions is calculated by combining Eq.[eq:Sh] and Eq.[eq:hr]:</p>
<p><br><span class="math display">$$r_{p}=\alpha \zeta [\bar{S}_p^{-1/m}-1]^{-1/n}.$$</span><br></p>
<p>The radius <span class="math inline"><em>r</em><sub><em>p</em></sub></span> divides the pore spectrum into a dry, inert part and a wet reactive part, which compensates for the change in mineral volume. For the calculation of the new PSD, only the pore radii of the wet pore space are multiplied by the proportionality factor <span class="math inline"><em>δ</em></span>.</p>
<h2 id="capillary-pressure">Capillary Pressure</h2>
<p>The calculation of change in capillary pressure after mineral reactions is straightforward since capillary pressure is proportional to <span class="math inline">1/<em>r</em></span>. Since the radius is changed from <span class="math inline"><em>r</em></span> to <span class="math inline"><em>r</em><em>δ</em></span> for <span class="math inline"><em>S</em> ≤ <em>S</em><sub><em>p</em></sub></span> and remains unchanged for <span class="math inline"><em>S</em> &gt; <em>S</em><sub><em>p</em></sub></span>, the new capillary pressure head is <br><span class="math display">$$
h(S)=\dfrac{h_0(S)}{\delta}
$$</span><br> if <span class="math inline"><em>S</em> ≤ <em>S</em><sub><em>p</em></sub>,</span> <br><span class="math display"><em>h</em>(<em>S</em>)=<em>h</em><sub>0</sub>(<em>S</em>)</span><br> if <span class="math inline"><em>S</em> &gt; <em>S</em><sub><em>p</em></sub></span>, where <span class="math inline"><em>h</em><sub>0</sub></span> is the initial capillary pressure head at saturation <span class="math inline"><em>S</em></span>. This means that capillary pressure is increased by a factor of <span class="math inline">1/<em>δ</em></span> for <span class="math inline"><em>S</em> ≤ <em>S</em><sub><em>p</em></sub></span> in the case of precipitation (<span class="math inline"><em>δ</em> &lt; 1</span>), and unchanged for <span class="math inline"><em>S</em> &gt; <em>S</em><sub><em>p</em></sub></span>. Note that the new <span class="math inline"><em>h</em></span>-<span class="math inline"><em>S</em></span> curve is not continuous at <span class="math inline"><em>S</em> = <em>S</em><sub><em>p</em></sub></span>. This is because that mineral precipitation/dissolution only occurs in the water phase where <span class="math inline"><em>S</em> ≤ <em>S</em><sub><em>p</em></sub></span>.</p>
<h2 id="permeability">Permeability</h2>
<p>The closed-form equation for permeability change due to mineral reactions is given in <span class="citation">(Liu et al. 2013)</span> as follows:</p>
<p><br><span class="math display">$$\dfrac{K}{K_0}=\tau^{1/2}[(\delta-1)(1-(1-\bar{S}_p^{1/m})^m)+1]^2,$$</span><br></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline"><em>τ</em></span> is the tortuosity factor, and <span class="math inline">$\tau=1-\bar{S}_p+\delta^2\bar{S}_p$</span>. <span class="citation">(Liu et al. 2013)</span> define this tortuosity factor to account for the fact that precipitated minerals impact tortuosity of porous media. This definition allows the tortuosity factor to have desirable values in two important cases: one for <span class="math inline"><em>δ</em> = 1</span> (without precipitation) and <span class="math inline">$(1-\bar{S}_p)^{1/2}$</span> for <span class="math inline"><em>δ</em> = 0</span></p>
<p>Here we derive this relation using the pore size distribution (PSD) function <span class="math inline"><em>f</em>(<em>r</em>)</span>, which will give us a slightly different result. The PSD function can be expressed by differentiation of the cumulative water content with respect to <span class="math inline"><em>r</em></span> <span class="citation">(Ritter and Drake 1945)</span>. Before chemical reactions,</p>
<p><br><span class="math display">$$f(r)=\dfrac{d\theta(r)}{dr}.$$</span><br></p>
<p>We denote the new PSD function as <span class="math inline"><em>f</em><sup>*</sup>(<em>r</em><sup>*</sup>)</span>, the new water content as <span class="math inline"><em>θ</em><sup>*</sup></span>, and the new radius as <span class="math inline"><em>r</em><sup>*</sup></span>. Recall that we defined the volume ratio before and after reactions as <span class="math inline"><em>β</em></span>, and the radius ratio as <span class="math inline"><em>δ</em></span>. Thus, we have <span class="math inline"><em>θ</em><sup>*</sup> = <em>θ</em><em>β</em></span>, <span class="math inline"><em>r</em><sup>*</sup> = <em>r</em><em>δ</em></span>. For <span class="math inline"><em>r</em> &lt; <em>r</em><sub><em>p</em></sub></span>, the new PSD function is</p>
<p><br><span class="math display">$$f^*(r^*)=\dfrac{d\theta^*(r^*)}{dr^*}=\dfrac{\beta}{\delta}f(\dfrac{r^*}{\delta}).$$</span><br></p>
<p>Following <span class="citation">(Liu et al. 2013)</span>, only the water occupied pores are modified,</p>
<p><br><span class="math display">$$\dfrac{K}{K_0}=\tau^{1/2}[\dfrac{\int_0^{r_p^*}r^*f^*(r^*)dr^*+\int_{r_p}^\infty rf(r)dr}{\int_0^\infty rf(r)dr}]^2,$$</span><br></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline"><em>r</em><sub><em>p</em></sub></span> is the threshold radius below which pores are occupied by water, and <span class="math inline"><em>r</em><sub><em>p</em></sub><sup>*</sup> = <em>r</em><sub><em>p</em></sub><em>δ</em></span>, which is the threshold radius post mineral reaction.</p>
<p>Substituting Eq.[eq:fstar] into Eq.[eq:Kfstar], we have</p>
<p><br><span class="math display">$$\dfrac{K}{K_0}=\tau^{1/2}[\dfrac{\int_0^{r_p} \delta\beta rf(r)dr+\int_{r_p}^\infty rf(r)dr}{\int_0^\infty rf(r)dr}]^2.$$</span><br></p>
<p>Using the mathematical relation <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="van1980closed"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>, <br><span class="math display">$$F(\bar{S})=\dfrac{\int_0^r rf(r)dr}{\int_0^\infty rf(r)dr}=1-(1-\bar{S}^{1/m})^m,$$</span><br></p>
<p>we obtain <br><span class="math display">$$\dfrac{K}{K_0}=\tau^{1/2}[(\delta\beta-1)(1-(1-\bar{S}_p^{1/m})^m)+1]^2.$$</span><br></p>
<p>Comparing Eq.[eq:Kfinal] with Eq.[eq:liu], the only difference is that <span class="citation">(Liu et al. 2013)</span> misses a <span class="math inline"><em>β</em></span> term.</p>
<h2 id="relative-permeability-of-water">Relative Permeability of Water</h2>
<p>Relative permeabilities are defined as the permeability of one phase divided by the saturated permeability, in our case, the saturated permeability of modified porous medium (<span class="math inline"><em>K</em></span>). However, for simplicity, we derive our new relative permeabilities as divided by the saturated permeability of the original porous medium (<span class="math inline"><em>K</em><sub>0</sub></span>). These relations can be corrected simply by using the factor <span class="math inline"><em>K</em>/<em>K</em><sub>0</sub></span> as expressed in Eq.[eq:Kfinal]. Let us denote the initial water permeability as <span class="math inline"><em>K</em><sub><em>w</em>0</sub></span>, relative permeability as <span class="math inline"><em>k</em><sub><em>w</em>0</sub></span>, and the new water permeability as <span class="math inline"><em>K</em><sub><em>w</em></sub></span>, relative permeability as <span class="math inline"><em>k</em><sub><em>w</em></sub></span>. Following <span class="citation">(Mualem 1976)</span>, we obtain</p>
<p><br><span class="math display">$$k_{w0}=\dfrac{K_{w0}}{K_0}=\tau^{1/2}[\dfrac{\int_0^r rf(r)dr}{\int_0^{\infty} rf(r)dr}]^2=\tau^{1/2}[F(\bar{S})]^2,$$</span><br></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">$\tau=\bar{S}$</span>.</p>
<p>When <span class="math inline"><em>S</em> ≤ <em>S</em><sub><em>p</em></sub></span>, the new relative permeability of water is,</p>
<p><br><span class="math display">$$k_w=\dfrac{K_w}{K_0}=\tau^{1/2}[\dfrac{\int_0^r \delta\beta rf(r)dr}{\int_0^{\infty} rf(r)dr}]^2=\tau^{1/2}[\delta\beta F(\bar{S})]^2,$$</span><br></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">$\tau=\delta^2 \bar{S}$</span>.</p>
<p>Thus, the ratio of the new water relative permeability over the initial water relative permeability is, <br><span class="math display">$$\dfrac{k_w}{k_{w0}}=\delta^3\beta^2 .$$</span><br></p>
<p>When <span class="math inline"><em>S</em> &gt; <em>S</em><sub><em>p</em></sub></span>, <br><span class="math display">$$k_w=\dfrac{K_w}{K_0}=\tau^{1/2}[\dfrac{\int_0^{r_p} \delta\beta rf(r)dr+\int_{r_p}^r rf(r)dr}{\int_0^{\infty} rf(r)dr}]^2=\tau^{1/2}[F(\bar{S})+(\delta\beta-1)F(\bar{S}_p)]^2,$$</span><br> where <span class="math inline">$\tau=\delta^2 \bar{S}_p + \bar{S}- \bar{S}_p$</span>.</p>

<p><span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="van1980closed"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span> did not give the explicit formulation for the relative permeability of non-wetting phase as a function of effective water saturation, but it is straightforward to derive this given the discussions above. Again, we denote the initial permeability of the non-wetting phase as <span class="math inline"><em>K</em><sub><em>g</em>0</sub></span>, relative permeability as <span class="math inline"><em>k</em><sub><em>g</em>0</sub></span>, and the new permeability of the non-wetting phase as <span class="math inline"><em>K</em><sub><em>g</em></sub></span>, relative permeability as <span class="math inline"><em>k</em><sub><em>g</em></sub></span>.

<h2 id="verification-with-pore-network-modeling">Verification with Pore Network Modeling</h2>
<p>In order to test the new equations for calculating changes of capillary pressure and relative permeabilities due to mineral precipitation and dissolution, we use pore network modeling (PNM) to compute these functions in a two-phase flow system. The model comprises a constrained set of parameters that mimic the pore structure of a porous medium.</p>
<p>PNM is commonly used to predict capillary pressure and relative permeability functions for multi-phase flow simulations, and uses idealized geometric representations of complex pore structures and principles of percolation/invasion theory <span class="citation">(Blunt 2001; Blunt et al. 2013)</span>. It is a well-established approach for calculating the small-scale petrophysical functions of two- and three-phase flow through porous media. Here we use the pore-network model of <span class="citation">(Ryazanov, Van Dijke, and Sorbie 2009)</span>. This model can be applied to complex unstructured pore-networks, considers film and layer-flow using thermodynamic criteria, uses a variety of shapes to represent the shapes of the pore throats, and has been extensively validated using experimental data.</p>
<h2 id="initial-pore-network-model">Initial Pore Network Model</h2>
<p>We use a realistic 3D pore-network extracted from pore-space reconstruction methods and CT images that are geometrically and topologically equivalent to the pore structures of a Berea sandstone sample (Fig.[fig:PNM]). The network consists of 12349 pores bodies (nodes) and 26146 pore throats (bonds). Each pore is assigned a regular shape (triangle, star, or circle) based on the shape factor which best matches that of the real pore shape. The average coordination number of this pore network is 4.19, initial permeability is 1639.47 mD, and porosity is 0.24. In this numerical experiment, we start with a fully water-saturated network (<span class="math inline"><em>S</em> = 1.0</span>). Then, the non-wetting phase is injected into the network for primary drainage. The pore network model calculates the capillary pressure curve and relative permeability curves as a function of water saturation through flooding. All floods are assumed to be capillary dominated and are simulated according to invasion-percolation principles.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="files/PNM.jpg" alt="Snap shot of the Berea pore network model at water saturation of 0.5." width="500"><p class="caption">Snap shot of the Berea pore network model at water saturation of 0.5.</p>
</div>
<p>The initial capillary pressure curve and relative permeability curves are shown in Fig.[fig:vanPc] and Fig.[fig:vanKr] for this pore network. They are calculated by running primary drainage of non-wetting phase through an initially water-saturated sample. As can be determined in Fig.[fig:vanPc] and Fig.[fig:vanKr], the residual saturation of water is 0.24.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="files/vanPc.png" width="500">
</div>
<div class="figure">
<img src="files/vanKr.png" width="500">
</div>
<p>In order to determine a reasonable value for the parameter <span class="math inline"><em>m</em></span>, we use Eq.[eq:Sh] to fit the capillary pressure curve in Fig.[fig:vanPc]. Resulting parameters from fitting the capillary pressure curve are <span class="math inline"><em>m</em> = 0.748, <em>α</em> = 0.0001994<em>P</em><em>a</em><sup>−1</sup></span>. To test this <span class="math inline"><em>m</em></span> value on the relative permeability curves, we used Eq.[eq:KrS_Mua] and compared results with the relative permeabilities calculated from pore network modeling. Results show that the van Genuchten/Mualem model presents a satisfactory fit of initial capillary pressure and relative permeability curves. We then use the value of <span class="math inline"><em>m</em></span> to predict how the capillary pressure curve and relative permeabilities change after chemical reactions, for a given amount of dissolved/precipitated minerals. The new capillary pressure and relative permeabilities are calculated from the initial values and the modification factors from our relations. The fitted initial van Genuchten/Mualem curves are not used in these calculation, thus do not affect the results. The main objective in the fitting process is to obtain the value of <span class="math inline"><em>m</em></span> which contains information on the shape of pore size distribution function, and is used in the relations.</p>
<h2 id="porosity-permeability-relationship">Porosity-Permeability Relationship</h2>
<p>For the purpose of comparing pore network modeling results with the new closed-form equations, we select two water saturations of 0.5 and 1.0 as the saturations at which mineral dissolution/precipitation occurs. Here we refer the two cases as the ‘new approach’ and the ‘traditional approach’ respectively since traditionally the relation between flow properties and chemical reactions are built on the assumption of full water saturation. In the new approach, we use the pore network model and run a primary drainage from the initial water-saturated condition to the target water saturation of 0.5. The bonds and nodes that are filled with water were identified in the pore network model when water saturation reaches <span class="math inline"><em>S</em><sub><em>p</em></sub> = 0.5</span>. As shown in Fig.[fig:PNM], the red is the invaded non-wetting phase at <span class="math inline"><em>S</em><sub><em>p</em></sub> = 0.5</span>, while the blue is water. Subsequently, the radii of the water-occupied bonds and nodes were modified by a factor of <span class="math inline"><em>δ</em></span> according to Eqs.[eq:beta] and [eq:delta] for a given porosity change. In the traditional approach, the pore radii of all pores and throats are modified in the pore network model given the same amount of porosity change. This corresponds to the traditional assumption in which chemical reactions are considered to occur in all pores. The modified pore network models using both approaches were flooded again with non-wetting phase starting from a fully water saturated condition to calculate the new permeability, capillary pressure and relative permeability curves.</p>
<p>Fig.[fig:PermPoro] shows permeabilities of modified pore network models as a function of porosity change using the two approaches. The values of <span class="math inline"><em>β</em></span> are calculated from the porosity change using Eq.[eq:beta_porosity] where <span class="math inline"><em>S</em><sub><em>p</em></sub> = 0.5, <em>ϕ</em><sub>0</sub> = 0.24</span>. Given that <span class="math inline"><em>β</em> ≥ 0</span>, we have <span class="math inline"><em>ϕ</em><sub><em>m</em><em>i</em><em>n</em></sub>/<em>ϕ</em><sub>0</sub> = 1 − <em>S</em><sub><em>p</em></sub> = 0.5</span>, which means that porosity cannot drop below 50% of its original value given <span class="math inline"><em>S</em><sub><em>p</em></sub> = 0.5</span>, because precipitation cannot be more than available pore volume. Ideally porosity does not have an upper limit due to dissolution. However, since the current work only considers the change in pore size, it will not be valid when the porosity increase is large and pore structure is heavily modified. In fact, there will probably be wormholes forming when porosity increases substantially, which has not yet been well modeled. For the range of porosity depicted in Fig.[fig:PermPoro] (0.19-0.27), the value of <span class="math inline"><em>β</em></span> ranges from 0.583 to 1.25, and the value of <span class="math inline"><em>δ</em></span> ranges from 0.088 to 2.73.</p>
<p>In Fig.[fig:PermPoro] it can be observed that using the traditional approach in which precipitation is assumed to happen in all pores and throats, permeability decreases up to 3 orders of magnitude when porosity decreases from 0.24 to 0.19. However, if precipitation is limited in the water occupied pores and throats, only the radii of the small pores and throats are decreased, while the other pores and throats remain unchanged. Thus permeability converges to a value which corresponds to all the unchanged pores and throats and does not decrease to zero. This is well captured by the present model, which we refer to as the modified <span class="citation">(Liu et al. 2013)</span> model because the <span class="citation">(Liu et al. 2013)</span> model only considered the change in radius but not in volume of the pores after mineral reactions as discussed in Section [S:3]. The permeability change can be characterized into two regions, a transitional stage from porosity 0.24 to 0.22, and a plateau where permeability is relatively constant when porosity is smaller than 0.22. Most of the permeability is contributed from the unchanged pores and throats on this plateau. The traditional method which assumes that all pores and throats are filled by precipitations fails to capture this result.</p>

<h2 id="capillary-pressure-and-relative-permeabilities">Capillary Pressure and Relative Permeabilities</h2>
<p>The predicted capillary pressure and relative permeabilities from pore network calculations are compared with our model in Figs.[fig:PcPcp]-[fig:KrgDss]. Two sets of calculations were conducted and compared. The first set of calculations assumes a decrease of porosity from 0.24 to 0.2015 (<span class="math inline"><em>β</em> = 0.6795, <em>δ</em> = 0.1757</span>), which represents precipitation, and the second set of calculations increases porosity from 0.24 to 0.2592 (<span class="math inline"><em>β</em> = 1.160, <em>δ</em> = 1.952</span>), which represents dissolution. The dashed lines in all figures are the initial capillary pressure or relative permeabilities. The solid lines represent predictions from our current model and the dots are results from pore network modeling. The initial PNM data is used directly in our model and modifications of this data are applied after dissolution or precipitation based on our new relations.</p>
<p>In Fig.[fig:PcPcp], capillary pressure is increased by a factor of <span class="math inline">1/<em>δ</em></span> for water saturation smaller than 0.5,using the new approach, while remains unchanged for water saturation larger than 0.5, according to Eq.[eq:PcPcp]. Thus, there is an offset at <span class="math inline"><em>S</em><sub><em>w</em></sub> = 0.5</span> that is well captured by our model and the pore network calculation. In Fig.[fig:KrwPcp], the relative permeability of water is decreased by a factor of <span class="math inline"><em>δ</em><sup>3</sup><em>β</em><sup>2</sup></span> for <span class="math inline"><em>S</em><sub><em>w</em></sub> &lt; 0.5</span> according to Eq.[eq:KrwPcp]. Again, there is an offset at <span class="math inline"><em>S</em><sub><em>w</em></sub> = 0.5</span>, and the change of relative permeability is less substantial for <span class="math inline"><em>S</em><sub><em>w</em></sub> &gt; 0.5</span>. The relative permeability of non-wetting phase in Fig.[fig:KrgPcp] is unchanged for <span class="math inline"><em>S</em><sub><em>w</em></sub> &gt; 0.5</span>, but reduced for <span class="math inline"><em>S</em><sub><em>w</em></sub> &lt; 0.5</span> according to Eq.[eq:KrgPcp].</p>

<p>In summary, the comparisons indicate that our proposed continuum-scale relations satisfactorily predict the pore-scale modeling results. The new method enables calculations of new permeability, capillary pressure and relative permeabilities in reservoir simulators after mineral reactions. It includes parameters that describe pore size distribution (<span class="math inline"><em>m</em></span>), the fraction of pore space that is water filled when precipitation happens (<span class="math inline"><em>S</em><sub><em>p</em></sub></span>), and the amount of precipitation/dissolution (<span class="math inline"><em>δ</em>, <em>β</em></span>). The related parameters are either model input (e.g., <span class="math inline"><em>m</em></span>), or intermediate modeling results (e.g., <span class="math inline"><em>S</em><sub><em>p</em></sub></span>), for calculating two-phase flow, so no new parameters need to be defined in reservoir simulators or reactive transport codes.</p>
<h1 id="discussions-and-conclusions">Discussions and Conclusions</h1>
<p>The capillary tube model, which is the foundation of the presented model, has several underlying assumptions <span class="citation">(Larson, Scriven, and Davis 1981)</span>. One is that the connectivity of real porous media and the irregular geometry of real porous matrices and associated effects are ignored. Also this model neglects the water wetting films in pores filled by a non-wetting phase. Hence we cannot model how chemical components diffuse through these water films and eventually react with a (small) fraction of the pore space. Despite these shortcomings, the capillary tube model is widely applied as a simple link between continuum-scale hydraulic properties and PSD’s <span class="citation">(Taylor and Jaffé 1990)</span>. In this paper we integrate the concept of modifying pore volumes through mineral reactions into more sophisticated pore network models to relate PSD’s to capillary pressure curve and relative permeabilites. Comparisons between our capillary tube model and pore network model show that satisfactory predictions can be achieved using the capillary tube model for changes in capillary pressure, permeability and relative permeabilites.</p>
<p>The main contribution in this paper is the advancement of continuum-scale models for the effect of chemical reactions on multi-phase flow properties. One key step in reactive transport modeling is to capture these effects for feedbacks of chemical reaction on fluid flow. Currently in most reactive transport simulators this is limited to estimating permeability change from porosity change. However, due to the fact that permeability is not a single function of porosity, but also a function of pore geometry, the current approach has large uncertainties. In this paper, we adopt the <span class="citation">Liu et al. (2013)</span> model for permeability change which not only considers porosity change but also takes into account pore size distribution and water saturation. We extend the <span class="citation">Liu et al. (2013)</span> model to multi-phase flow properties, and provide closed-form equations on how capillary pressure and relative permeabilities should change due to chemical reactions. These relations are continuum-scale equations, and can be implemented in reactive transport models directly without introducing additional parameters.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>In CO<span class="math inline"><em></em><sub>2</sub></span> sequestration, well injectivity is a critical issue. The injected dry gas, at low water-vapor partial pressure, will equilibrate with the formation brine and water will evaporate into the flowing CO<span class="math inline"><em></em><sub>2</sub></span> stream. Water salinity increases as a result and eventually precipitates out salt. This effect has been reported for gas producing wells in reservoirs of high salinity brine <span class="citation">(Kleinitz, Dietzsch, and Köhler 2003)</span> and during storage of natural gas <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="place1984unusual"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>. The source of extra pressure build-up in the Ketzin <span class="citation">(Baumann, Henninges, and De Lucia 2014)</span> and Snohvit <span class="citation">(Grude, Landrø, and Dvorkin 2014)</span> CO<span class="math inline"><em></em><sub>2</sub></span> storage projects is partly assigned to salt precipitation. Probably because few large-scale pilots have been built for CO<span class="math inline"><em></em><sub>2</sub></span> sequestration, direct observations of salt precipitation have not been available at field scale. Right now we rely on numerical simulations <span class="citation">(Giorgis, Carpita, and Battistelli 2007; K. Pruess and Müller 2009; Qiao et al. 2014; Zeidouni, Pooladi-Darvish, and Keith 2009)</span> and experimental studies <span class="citation">(Pearce et al. 1996; Andre, Peysson, and Azaroual 2014; Ott, Roels, and De Kloe 2015; S. M. Roels et al. 2016; Muller et al. 2009; Tang et al. 2015; Y. Wang et al. 2010)</span> to determine the key parameters involved so that we can correctly model well injectivity on the field scale.</p>

<p>Field-scale simulations require input on flow physics such as the porosity-permeability relationship. Porosity change can be calculated simply from the volume of precipitated salt. The change of permeability, however, is a complex problem. The most widely used porosity-permeability relationship in current numerical simulations is the tube-in-series model proposed by <span class="citation">Verma and Pruess (1988)</span>. This model allows to reach zero permeability even if porosity is not nil. In this model, pore geometry is conceptualized as a series of one-dimensional tubes that are identical to each other. Each tube consists of wide and narrow segments, and the permeability value is dominated by the local radii of the narrowest part of the tube. When salt precipitates on the tube walls, the local permeability for the narrow segments decreases much more rapidly than those for the wide segments. The result is clogging of the entire tube. <span class="citation">K. Pruess and Müller (2009)</span> used this relationship in their numerical simulator TOUGH2 <span class="citation">(K. Pruess 1991)</span> to explore the role of different parameters in the salt precipitation process and found that injectivity could be reduced significantly. For the given parameter values used in <span class="citation">K. Pruess and Müller (2009)</span>, reservoir permeability is reduced to zero when precipitated salt occupies 10% of the pore space.</p>

<p>Most recent publications related to salt precipitation in CO<span class="math inline"><em></em><sub>2</sub></span> storage have used the <span class="citation">Verma and Pruess (1988)</span> porosity-permeability relationship, but with different parameter values from fitting of experimental data <span class="citation">(Andre, Peysson, and Azaroual 2014; Muller et al. 2009; Bacci, Durucan, and Korre 2013; Giorgis, Carpita, and Battistelli 2007; Guyant et al. 2015; Ott, Roels, and De Kloe 2015)</span>. Exceptions are the papers by <span class="citation">Zeidouni, Pooladi-Darvish, and Keith (2009)</span> and <span class="citation">Tang et al. (2015)</span> where they use the simple Kozeny-Carman grain model <span class="citation">(P. C. Carman 1956; P. Carman 1997)</span> based on spheres to calculate changes in permeability due to changes in porosity. Recently, <span class="citation">Liu et al. (2013)</span> points out that the <span class="citation">Verma and Pruess (1988)</span> relation between permeability change and salt precipitation is based on a single phase flow model, but CO<span class="math inline"><em></em><sub>2</sub></span> sequestration involves two phases. They conceptualize the porous media as a series of tubes with different sizes, and develop a new relation between permeability change and salt precipitation that considers the fact that salt precipitation occurs only in the pore space occupied by brine during the precipitation process. This model is in agreement with observations by <span class="citation">Ott, Roels, and De Kloe (2015)</span> in which they conduct core flooding experiments and claim that there is no transport mechanism of liquid water vapor across the CO<span class="math inline"><em></em><sub>2</sub></span> brine interface and hence no transport mechanism of salt into the CO<span class="math inline"><em></em><sub>2</sub></span> flow channels. These CO<span class="math inline"><em></em><sub>2</sub></span> flow channels will stay open since salt precipitates in the residual brine phase.</p>
<p>Compared to the <span class="citation">Verma and Pruess (1988)</span> model in which permeability change is a single function of porosity change, the <span class="citation">Liu et al. (2013)</span> model relates permeability change to not only porosity change, but also pore size distribution and water saturation at which precipitation takes place. The <span class="citation">Liu et al. (2013)</span> model is also a continuum-scale relation in that all parameters involved are available in current reservoir simulators. It is thus possible to implement this relation in a reservoir simulation code.</p>

<h2 id="what-porosity-permeability-relationships-are-used-in-recent-studies">What porosity-permeability relationships are used in recent studies</h2>
<p><span class="citation">Bacci, Korre, and Durucan (2011)</span> conducted core flooding experiments with supercritical CO<span class="math inline"><em></em><sub>2</sub></span>, and used the <span class="citation">Verma and Pruess (1988)</span> model to fit the experimental data. The reduced porosities from several experiments were plotted against permeability reductions. However, readers need to note that in this plot each data point is an averaged porosity and permeability of the entire core. In most such experiments, salt precipitation is heterogeneous inside the core and more salt precipitates close to the injection zone. In numerical simulations of core flooding experiments, the core is discretized into a number of grid blocks. Porosity change is monitored in each grid block. The porosity-permeability relationship is also applied in each grid block to calculate the corresponding permeability change. Thus, the porosity-permeability relationship obtained from the average porosity and permeability measurements of the entire core does not necessarily represent the true porosity-permeability relationship for each grid cell, especially when salt precipitation has large variations through the core.</p>
<p><span class="citation">Ott, Roels, and De Kloe (2015)</span> used the same <span class="citation">Verma and Pruess (1988)</span> model to fit their experimental data, but introduced a new term which was the lowest value to which permeability can be reduced by precipitation. They also argued that the maximum pore volume that could be filled by precipitate was the volume corresponding to the residual brine saturation, thus the critical porosity was 0.8 (assuming residual water saturation was 0.2). Using these constraints, they determined a rather large exponential term equal to 10.1.</p>
<p><span class="citation">Giorgis, Carpita, and Battistelli (2007)</span> used the <span class="citation">Verma and Pruess (1988)</span> as a regression function to fit their extended Verma and Pruess model, and determined an exponential term equal to 4.1 and a critical porosity of 0.3. <span class="citation">K. Pruess and Müller (2009)</span> chose parameters similar to what was used in another study of permeability changes due to precipitation of amorphous silica at a geothermal injection well in the Philippines <span class="citation">(T. Xu et al. 2004)</span>, with the exponential term being equal to 2 and the critical porosity equal to 0.9.</p>
<p><span class="citation">Tang et al. (2015)</span> and <span class="citation">Zeidouni, Pooladi-Darvish, and Keith (2009)</span> used the simple Kozeny-Carman grain model based on spheres to calculated changes in permeability due to changes in porosity. <span class="citation">Zeidouni, Pooladi-Darvish, and Keith (2009)</span> used the equation with no tunable parameters, while <span class="citation">Tang et al. (2015)</span> included an exponential coefficient and used experimental data to determine its value. Exponent 2.4 was demonstrated through the data regression with the minimum deviation.</p>
<p><span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="mohamed2013fluid"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span> used both the Carman-Kozeny relation and power law to fit experimental data. They found that the exponent terms cover a large range of values, from around 4 to as high as 400. The significant reduction of permeability corresponding to the large exponents are mainly because of the pore-throat plugging by fines migration due to the presence of silicate minerals in dolomite rock.</p>
<p>It seems to us that, compared to other models, the <span class="citation">Liu et al. (2013)</span> model provides a more physics sound relation for porosity and permeability evolution, since it honors the physical process of salt precipitation in a two-phase system and is based on well-established relative permeability relationships.</p>

<span class="citation">Liu et al. (2013)</span> model</h2>
<p>In <span class="citation">Liu et al. (2013)</span>, the pore space of a porous medium is conceptualized as cylindrical capillaries with a continuous distribution of radii <span class="math inline"><em>r</em></span>. A given capillary can be either water-filled or completely dry, depending on the saturation state of the medium. With this geometric idealization, the capillary pressure-water saturation curve can be interpreted to represent continuous cumulative pore-size distribution (PSD). In a given portion of the porous medium (in computational terms this would be a cell within the modeled domain), at any time the water content is known. Due to precipitation/dissolution, the pore volume will change and thus the capillary pressure curve changes also. The maximum radius up to which pores are water-filled and therefore affected by mineral reactions can be calculated from capillary pressure head:</p>
<p><br><span class="math display">$$r = \frac{1}{h},$$</span><br></p>
<p>where <em>r</em> is the threshold radius and <em>h</em> is the capillary pressure head. The corresponding effective water saturation <em>S</em> is defined as:</p>
<p><br><span class="math display">$$S=\frac{\theta-\theta_{r}}{\theta_{s}-\theta_{r}},$$</span><br></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline"><em>θ</em></span> is the wetting-phase content (the ratio of wetting-phase volume to the corresponding bulk volume of a porous medium), and subscripts <em>s</em> and <em>r</em> refer to saturated and residual values for <span class="math inline"><em>θ</em></span>.</p>
<p>The capillary pressure head <em>h</em> is given as a function of effective wetting-phase saturation by <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="van1980closed"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>:</p>
<p><br><span class="math display"><em>S</em> = [1 + (<em>α</em><em>h</em>)<sup><em>n</em></sup>]<sup>−<em>m</em></sup>,</span><br></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline"><em>α</em></span> and <em>m=1-1/n</em> are empirical parameters.</p>
<p>Before mineral reactions, the relative permeability of the wetting phase <em><span class="math inline"><em>k</em><sub><em>r</em></sub></span></em> can be expressed by <span class="citation">Mualem (1976)</span>:</p>
<p><br><span class="math display">$$k_r=S^{1/2} [\dfrac{\int_0^s (1/h(x))dx}{\int_0^1 (1/h(x))dx}]^2.$$</span><br></p>
<p>Thus, we have</p>
<p><br><span class="math display"><em>k</em><sub><em>r</em></sub>(<em>S</em>)=<em>S</em><sup>1/2</sup>[1 − (1 − <em>S</em><sup>1/<em>m</em></sup>)<sup><em>m</em></sup>]<sup>2</sup>.</span><br></p>
<p>The changes in pore geometry during salt precipitation is a complex process. Here a strict dependency of salt precipitation on solution concentrations is assumed, in other words, the amount of precipitated salt in a given pore is linearly dependent on its pore volume. Also the change in pore volume is assumed to be uniform within a given pore.</p>
<p>Denoting the brine content and corresponding effective saturation at the time when mineral reaction starts as <span class="math inline"><em>θ</em><sub><em>p</em></sub></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>S</em><sub><em>p</em></sub></span>, the ratio of pore volume after chemical reactions to that before reactions, <span class="math inline"><em>β</em></span>, can be defined as</p>
<p><br><span class="math display">$$\beta=\dfrac{\theta_p-\theta_{salt}}{\theta_p},$$</span><br></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline"><em>θ</em><sub><em>s</em><em>a</em><em>l</em><em>t</em></sub></span> is the content of precipitated salt, defined as the volume of salt precipitation divided by the bulk volume of a porous medium. The ratio <span class="math inline"><em>δ</em></span> of the hydraulic radius (for a pore after precipitation) to its original radius can be approximated to be a power function of the corresponding volume ratio <span class="citation">(Liu et al. 2013)</span>:</p>
<p><br><span class="math display"><em>δ</em> = <em>β</em><sup><em>χ</em></sup>,</span><br></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline"><em>χ</em></span> is an empirical parameter equal to 4.5.</p>
<p>In previous studies <span class="citation">(Verma and Pruess 1988)</span>, changes in pore volume were modeled as affecting the entire pore spectrum despite the fact that salt precipitation occurs only in the water-filled pores. Here, instead, only changes in pore volumes in the wet part of the porous medium are translated to pore radii.</p>
<p>In a given portion of the porous medium, at any time the water saturation is known. The maximum radius up to which pores are water-filled and therefore affected by salt precipitation is calculated as:</p>
<p><br><span class="math display"><em>r</em><sub><em>p</em></sub> = <em>α</em>[<em>S</em><sub><em>p</em></sub><sup>1/<em>m</em></sup> − 1]<sup>−1/<em>n</em></sup>.</span><br></p>
<p>The radius <span class="math inline"><em>r</em><sub><em>p</em></sub></span> divides the pore spectrum into a dry, inert part and a wet reactive part, which has to compensate for the change in pore volume. For the calculation of the new PSD, only the pore radii of the wet pore space are multiplied by the proportionality factor <span class="math inline"><em>δ</em></span>.</p>
<p>The cumulative PSD represents the relative volume of drainable pores with a radius equal to or smaller than <span class="math inline"><em>r</em></span>. The drainable pore-size density function is obtained by differentiation of the cumulative PSD with respect to <span class="math inline"><em>r</em></span>:</p>
<p><br><span class="math display">$$f(r)=\dfrac{d\theta(r)}{dr}.$$</span><br></p>
<p>We denote the new PSD function after salt precipitation as <span class="math inline"><em>f</em><sup>*</sup>(<em>r</em><sup>*</sup>)</span>, the new water content as <span class="math inline"><em>θ</em><sup>*</sup></span>, and the new radius as <span class="math inline"><em>r</em><sup>*</sup></span>. Recall that we define the volume ratio before and after reactions as <span class="math inline"><em>β</em></span>, and the radius ratio as <span class="math inline"><em>δ</em></span>. Thus, we have <span class="math inline"><em>θ</em><sup>*</sup> = <em>θ</em><em>β</em></span>, <span class="math inline"><em>r</em><sup>*</sup> = <em>r</em><em>δ</em></span>, and</p>
<p><br><span class="math display">$$f^*(r^*)=\dfrac{d\theta^*(r^*)}{dr^*}=\dfrac{\beta}{\delta}f(\dfrac{r^*}{\delta}).$$</span><br></p>
<p>Following <span class="citation">Liu et al. (2013)</span>, we have <br><span class="math display">$$\dfrac{K}{K_0}=\tau^{1/2}[\dfrac{\int_0^{r_p^*}r^*f^*(r^*)dr^*+\int_{r_p}^\infty rf(r)df}{\int_0^\infty rf(r)dr}]^2,$$</span><br></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline"><em>r</em><sub><em>p</em></sub></span> is the threshold radius below which pores are occupied by water, and <span class="math inline"><em>r</em><sub><em>p</em></sub><sup>*</sup> = <em>r</em><sub><em>p</em></sub><em>δ</em></span>, which is the threshold radius post mineral reaction.</p>
<p>Thus, we have</p>
<p><br><span class="math display">$$\dfrac{K}{K_0}=\tau^{1/2}[\dfrac{\int_0^{r_p} \delta\beta rf(r)dr+\int_{r_p}^\infty rf(r)dr}{\int_0^\infty rf(r)dr}]^2.$$</span><br></p>
<p>Using the mathematical relation <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="van1980closed"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>,</p>
<p><br><span class="math display">$$f(S)=\dfrac{\int_0^r rf(r)dr}{\int_0^\infty rf(r)dr}=1-(1-S^{1/m})^m,$$</span><br></p>

<h2 id="compare-with-experimental-measurements">Compare with experimental measurements</h2>
<p>Porosity-permeability relations fitted from experimental data provide empirical equations for field scale simulations, and sometimes such empirical relations are the most reliable options. However, due to the heterogeneity of salt precipitation in core flooding experiments, using the average porosity and permeability reduction measured for the entire core may not be a valid approach. Several experimental studies <span class="citation">(Peysson, Andre, and Azaroual 2014; Ott, Roels, and De Kloe 2015)</span> have observed that the decrease in water saturation at the injection surface induces brine capillary back flow that transfers the brine toward the injection surface. Salt accumulates near the injection surface and precipitates when saturation is reached. In numerical simulations of such experiments, the representative element volume (REV) is defined as one thin slice of the core. In <span class="citation">Andre, Peysson, and Azaroual (2014)</span>, the 60 mm long core was represented by 60 grid cells, with each cell being 1.0 mm thick, and most salt precipitation accumulated in the first few millimeters of the core, close to the injection zone. The porosity-permeability relationship is an equation that describes the physics in each REV, which is the 1.0 mm slice in this case. Using the porosity and permeability data for the entire core to fit a porosity-permeability relationship is not conceptually consistent with the REVs in numerical models. In fact, the capillary back flow and precipitation of salt near the injection zone can be reproduced by continuum-scale numerical models with two-phase Darcy flow, capillary pressure, and thermodynamics of salt precipitation. The porosity-permeability relationship should not double account for the rapid permeability reduction by heterogeneous precipitation. Given the difficulty in measuring porosity and permeability change in each slice of a core sample, the best data for fitting the porosity-permeability relation comes from experiments where salt precipitation is homogeneous along the core. <span class="citation">Ott, Roels, and De Kloe (2015)</span> found that there is a critical flow rate above which salt precipitates homogeneously. At high injection rate, the viscose force increases, and the capillary force becomes less important to drive back flow. Using a flow rate of 4.4 ml/min, they observed a uniform salt saturation of 0.04 throughout the core after drying. However, such experimental data is rare, and in most experiments heterogeneous precipitation of salt is observed <span class="citation">(Peysson, Andre, and Azaroual 2014; Andre, Peysson, and Azaroual 2014; Ott, Roels, and De Kloe 2015)</span>. One other option is to deliberately cut off the zone close to injection inlet and examine the rest of the core where precipitation is relatively uniform. In order to measure the permeability of a fraction of the core, pressure needs to be measured not only at the inlet and outlet, but also along the core length at discrete locations. Such measurements can be achieved by using side taps as in the setup in <span class="citation">Y. Wang et al. (2010)</span>.</p>

<p><span class="citation">Liu et al. (2013)</span> used the experimental work by <span class="citation">Y. Wang et al. (2010)</span> to compare their predictions on permeability change with experimental observations. The flood experiments were performed on brine saturated cores that were 1.5 inch in diameter and 1 foot longe. <span class="citation">Liu et al. (2013)</span> selected the data for the core segment between two side taps (3cm-13.05cm) and avoided the zone near the injection inlet (0-3cm). The ratio of the new permeability for this segment after CO<span class="math inline"><em></em><sub>2</sub></span> dry-out to the initial permeability measured in the experiment is 0.55, and the value predicted from the <span class="citation">Liu et al. (2013)</span> model is between 0.50 and 0.57. The prediction from the <span class="citation">Liu et al. (2013)</span> model is indeed close to the experimental measurement.</p>
<p>Here we also calculate the predicted permeability ratio using the <span class="citation">Verma and Pruess (1988)</span> model and compare it with the experimental measurement in <span class="citation">Y. Wang et al. (2010)</span>. In the laboratory test the salt mass fraction in brine <span class="math inline"><em>X</em><sub><em>s</em><em>a</em><em>l</em><em>t</em></sub></span> was 25.0%. The core was initially saturated with brine, and the breakthrough of supercritical CO<span class="math inline"><em></em><sub>2</sub></span> happened at about 0.3 pore volume (PV) of injection. Since the displaced brine had little time to interact with CO<span class="math inline"><em></em><sub>2</sub></span>, it is reasonable to assume that there was no salt precipitation form the displaced brine, and the remaining brine in the core when precipitation starts was 0.7 PV. The brine production slowed down greatly after the breakthrough, and CO<span class="math inline"><em></em><sub>2</sub></span> continued to flood through the core for all the remaining brine to evaporate into. In total, about 176 PV of supercritical CO<span class="math inline"><em></em><sub>2</sub></span> was injected into the core. Thus, the amount of salt precipitation at the end of flooding is estimated to be</p>

<h2 id="does-salt-precipitate-in-the-aqueous-phase">Does salt precipitate in the aqueous phase?</h2>
<p>The key assumption in the <span class="citation">Liu et al. (2013)</span> relation is that salt precipitates in the water occupied pore space. The assumption is reasonable given that salt initially dissolves in water and can only precipitates out of water. <span class="citation">Ott, Roels, and De Kloe (2015)</span> conducted core flooding experiments of CO<span class="math inline"><em></em><sub>2</sub></span> replacing brine in a sandstone sample and used micron CT to image the distribution of solid salt and the initial CO<span class="math inline"><em></em><sub>2</sub></span> in the pore space. Their 3D representation of the solid salt distribution and the early CO<span class="math inline"><em></em><sub>2</sub></span> percolation pattern showed that both patterns occupied complementary space and overlapped by less than 5% of the common cross section. This indicated that salt precipitated in the vicinity of the initially CO<span class="math inline"><em></em><sub>2</sub></span> occupied volume, leaving the initial CO<span class="math inline"><em></em><sub>2</sub></span> pathways essentially open. They thus claim that there is no transport mechanism of liquid water vapor across the CO<span class="math inline"><em></em><sub>2</sub></span>-brine interface and hence no transport mechanism of salt into the CO<span class="math inline"><em></em><sub>2</sub></span> channels, and the flow channels stay open since salt precipitates in the residual brine phase.</p>
<p><span class="citation">Miri et al. (2015)</span> conducted lab-on-chip experiments to explore the dynamics of salt precipitation at the pore-scale, and reached opposite conclusions. They found that salt aggregates attracted water from the adjacent network grains via continuous water films around the mineral grains through surface energy effects, and this enabled continued feeding of the evaporating front with fresh brine, thus allowing the continued growth of salt on these aggregates. The result of this mechanism was a large accumulation of salt in the form of aggregates in the gas phase. An important requirement for this self-enhancing mechanism was the interconnected films that were relative thick on the surface of grains. However, the existence of such thick water film and their practical significance in hydraulic conductivity needs further investigation. The flow mechanism associated with this significant film flow is not considered in this study.</p>

<h2 id="numerical-simulation">Numerical Simulation</h2>
<p>By reviewing how the <span class="citation">Verma and Pruess (1988)</span> and <span class="citation">Liu et al. (2013)</span> relations are derived, it is clear that the <span class="citation">Verma and Pruess (1988)</span> relation is based on the capillary tube concept and assumes that mineral precipitation happens in all tubes, and that all tubes are identical. The <span class="citation">Liu et al. (2013)</span> relation takes into account the pore size distribution function (m), and distinguishes between the water occupied tubes and gas occupied tubes (using water saturation). In CO<span class="math inline"><em></em><sub>2</sub></span> sequestration, the simulations obviously involve two phases, i.e., CO<span class="math inline"><em></em><sub>2</sub></span> gas and water. For example, if water saturation is 50% when water evaporates into the CO<span class="math inline"><em></em><sub>2</sub></span> plume, the precipitated salt should clog the water occupied tubes, which are theoretically the small ones since water is the wetting phase. So only this 50% pore volume should be affected by salt precipitation. The <span class="citation">Verma and Pruess (1988)</span> relation distributes the precipitated salt uniformly in all tubes. They assume that all tubes are identical but part of each tube has a small radius, so the distributed salt clogs the narrow part of the tubes first, thus clogging the entire porous medium. This approach predicts dramatic reduction of permeability by salt precipitation in their numerical simulation. However, different results are possible if the <span class="citation">Liu et al. (2013)</span> relation is used. In this paper we implement the <span class="citation">Liu et al. (2013)</span> relation in the TOUGH2 reservoir simulator, and re-run the reservoir simulation similar to the one in <span class="citation">K. Pruess and Müller (2009)</span>. Results using both the <span class="citation">K. Pruess and Müller (2009)</span> model and the <span class="citation">Liu et al. (2013)</span> model are presented in this section.</p>

<h2 id="model-setup">Model setup</h2>
<p>The numerical simulations described here are performed using the general purpose reservoir simulation code TOUGH2, coupled with the fluid property module ECO2N <span class="citation">(K. Pruess and Spycher 2007)</span>. Two simulations are conducted, one using the <span class="citation">Verma and Pruess (1988)</span> relation for porosity and permeability and the other using the <span class="citation">Liu et al. (2013)</span> relation. All other input parameters are identical for the two simulations.</p>
<p>We consider a basic problem of CO<span class="math inline"><em></em><sub>2</sub></span> injection into a saline aquifer under conditions that may be encountered in brine aquifers at a depth of the order of 1.2 km. A CO<span class="math inline"><em></em><sub>2</sub></span> injection well fully penetrates a homogeneous, isotropic, infinite-acting aquifer of 100 m thickness, at conditions of 12 MPa pressure, 45 C temperature, and a salinity of 0.25 by weight. Porosity is set at 24.02%, and permeability at 1.66 Darcy. The residual water saturation is assumed to be 0.30. The relative permeability and capillary pressure have been calculated using the <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="van1980closed"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span> models. The relative equations and parameters are listed in Table 1. CO<span class="math inline"><em></em><sub>2</sub></span> is injected at a constant rate of 100 kg/s. This problem is similar to the model in <span class="citation">K. Pruess and Müller (2009)</span>.</p>
<p>The well is modeled as a circular grid element of R = 0.3 m. The numerical grid is extended to a large distance of 100 km, so that the system would be infinite-acting for the time period simulated (10,000 days, 27.38 years). The upper and lower boundaries of the formation are closed, simulating impermeable layers at the top and bottom of the reservoir.</p>
<p>The modeled processes include two-phase flow of CO<span class="math inline"><em></em><sub>2</sub></span> and water subject to relative permeability and capillary effects, change of fluid density, viscosity, and CO<span class="math inline"><em></em><sub>2</sub></span> solubility with pressure and salinity, and formation dry-out with precipitation of salt. Salt precipitation is monitored and quantified by the change of solid saturation, which is the fraction of pore volume occupied by salt. The resulting porosities are calculated from the solid saturation values and the permeabilities are estimated using the implemented porosity-permeability relationships.</p>

<p>The <span class="citation">Verma and Pruess (1988)</span> relation predicts that permeability decreases to almost zero near the injection well, while the <span class="citation">Liu et al. (2013)</span> relation predicts that the final permeability is around 50% of the initial permeability near the injection well.</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>Systematic experiments are in need to validate the porosity-permeability relations proposed by <span class="citation">Verma and Pruess (1988)</span> and <span class="citation">Liu et al. (2013)</span>. Such experiments should include measurement of porosity and permeability in well defined representative element volumes. Two mechanisms could cause severe reduction of core permeability, although this reduction should not be double accounted for by the porosity-permeability relation intended for the REVs as discussed above. One mechanism is the capillary driven back flow that transport brine to close to the injection surface. Pore space is thus filled with more salt at these locations. The other possible mechanism is a boundary effect at the injection surface. Since the brine at the injection surface is fully exposed to CO<span class="math inline"><em></em><sub>2</sub></span> gas, and initially the brine occupies all pore space at the injection surface, it is possible that this brine will all evaporate and leave the entire injection surface clogged. The core permeability will be zero with this one surface clogged.</p>
<p>Field observation of salt precipitation in CO<span class="math inline"><em></em><sub>2</sub></span> sequestration projects have not been reported yet, but will be invaluable once available. Such observations can be used to confirm whether salt precipitation is severe at the injection surface, and whether capillary back flow is important at conditions encountered in field operations.</p>

<h2 id="methods">Methods</h2>
<p>In ocean drilling sites where calcite dissolution rate and precipitation rate are almost equal (<span class="math inline"><em>R</em><sub><em>p</em></sub> = <em>R</em><sub><em>d</em></sub></span>), the recrystallization rate <span class="math inline"><em>R</em></span> can be defined as <span class="math inline"><em>R</em> = <em>R</em><sub><em>p</em></sub> = <em>R</em><sub><em>d</em></sub></span>. In such cases, Ca concentration cannot be used to calculate the recrystallization rates since the Ca concentration is affected only by the net precipitation rate, which is close to zero in these cases. Trace elements or isotopes, however, are not in equilibrium between the pore fluid and the solid. Their concentrations can therefore provide information on the exchange rate of calcite dissolution and precipitation. We use Sr concentration to infer the recrystallization which has been proven successful in <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="fantle2007isotopes"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>.</p>
<p>The evolution of Sr concentration in the pore fluid (<span class="math inline"><em>C</em><sub><em>f</em></sub></span>) can be describe by the equation: <br><span class="math display">$$
\dfrac{\partial C_f}{\partial t}=D \dfrac{\partial ^2 C_f}{\partial z^2}-v\dfrac{\partial C_f}{\partial z}+f_cRM(C_s-KC_f),
$$</span><br> where <span class="math inline"><em>M</em> = <em>ρ</em><sub><em>s</em></sub>(1 − <em>ϕ</em>)/(<em>ρ</em><sub><em>f</em></sub><em>ϕ</em>)</span>, <span class="math inline"><em>K</em></span> is the equilibrium distribution coefficient of Sr between the solid and the fluid, and <span class="math inline"><em>f</em><sub><em>c</em></sub></span> is the fraction of calcite in the solid. <span class="math inline"><em>z</em> = 0</span> is defined as the interface between sea water and the sediment, and <span class="math inline"><em>z</em></span> is positive in the downward direction.</p>
<p>We assume that porosity, fluid density, solid density, the distribution coefficient <span class="math inline"><em>K</em></span>, Sr concentration in the solid <span class="math inline"><em>C</em><sub><em>s</em></sub></span>, and the recrystallization rate <span class="math inline"><em>R</em></span> are all constants with depth. The value of M is close to 1.1 assuming that <span class="math inline"><em>ϕ</em> = 0.7</span>. <span class="math inline"><em>K</em></span> is close to 20, and <span class="math inline"><em>D</em></span> is close to 7500 <span class="math inline"><em>m</em><sup>2</sup>/<em>M</em><em>y</em><em>r</em></span> <span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="fantle2007isotopes"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span>.</p>
<p>We further assume that the Sr concentration is at steady state, so the term <span class="math inline">∂<em>C</em><sub><em>f</em></sub>/∂<em>t</em></span> is zero. The Sr concentration in pore fluid at the upper boundary is fixed at the modern seawater concentration (91 <span class="math inline"><em>μ</em><em>M</em></span>). Under these conditions, the solution for <span class="math inline"><em>C</em><sub><em>f</em></sub></span> is <br><span class="math display">$$
C_f=\dfrac{C_s}{K}+(C_w-\dfrac{C_s}{K})e^{-z/L},
$$</span><br> where <span class="math inline"><em>C</em><sub><em>w</em></sub> = 91<em>u</em><em>M</em></span>. The exponential factor is: <br><span class="math display">$$
L^{-1}=(\dfrac {v^2}{4D^2}+\dfrac{f_cRMK}{D})^{1/2}-\dfrac{v}{2D}.
$$</span><br> For each site, the value of <span class="math inline"><em>L</em></span> can be obtained by fitting the Sr concentration profile with depth with two tunable parameters, <span class="math inline"><em>L</em></span> and <span class="math inline"><em>C</em><sub><em>s</em></sub>/<em>K</em></span>. The best value for <span class="math inline"><em>L</em></span> is then used in calculating recrystallization rate of calcite based on the following equation: <br><span class="math display">$$
R=(\dfrac{1}{L^2}+\dfrac{V}{LD})\dfrac{D}{f_cMK}
$$</span><br> where <span class="math inline"><em>M</em> = 1.1, <em>K</em> = 20, <em>D</em> = 7500<em>m</em><sup>2</sup>/<em>M</em><em>y</em><em>r</em></span>.</p>
<p><span class="math inline"><em>f</em><sub><em>c</em></sub></span> is calculated using the average calcite fraction in the top 200 meters of the sediments. <span class="math inline"><em>V</em></span> is calculated using the average sedimentation rate for the sediments that are younger than 10 Myr. Compaction is not considered. Depth is fitted with age using a linear relationship to calculate the average sedimentation rate.</p>
<p>Site 1052 and 1053 do not have age data younger than 10 Myr. There seems to be no deposition of sediments in the recent 30 Myr. Their sedimentation rates are thus assigned zeros. Age data for Site 1092, 1238 and 1258 are not available. The sedimentation rates for these sites are estimated as follows: Site 1238 is ~ 70m/Myr sed rate. Site 1258 has early Eocene sediments at the top (more or less) so sed rate ~ 0. Site 1092 has variable sed rate, but averages about 15m/Myr down to about 180m depth.</p>
